Backend: Express, MongoDB (blogposts served through db), Mongoose

Frontend: React, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Node.js 

Future: projects, extend blog to include devlog, subblogs

todo/bugs: 
1) fix router to prevent api call during raw data (change routes to /api) 
2) make blogpost dropdown sticky for more than one
