Personal Website V2 

What to change from V1? 

    Pull the following from backend: 
        blogposts

    That might be all thats necessary 

    Possible devblog for new projects?
    Seperate into personal writing blog and devblog

    Would be funny to use OpenAI api to create a chatbot version of myself
